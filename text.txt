I stumbled across my first job completely by chance. I was just out of high school, enjoying the small sliver of freedom before the existential dread of wondering what I would do with the rest of my life set in. So when I wondered path a coffee shop and saw a "Now Hiring" sign taped in the window, I thought, why not try this? It seemed at the time like the path of least resistance. 

Martha's is a small, out-of-the-way place. Somewhere people stumble upon by surprise, drawn in by the novelty and charm of their hand-painted sign and faded curtains tied up in the windows. It has an air I would generously describe as homey; mismatched chairs and cushions, wobbly tables with dents and permanent stains, the creaky wooden floor whose slats don't quite line up. It could seat maybe twenty people if it were at capacity (which it never is), though really the room should've allowed for no more than ten if the seats weren't crammed tight enough to make maneuvering to the corner tables without splashing some of your drink on the floor next to impossible.

When I went inside that day and asked about the job, the barista at the counter directed me a back room the size of a storage closet that was functioning as an office. She handed me an application that I filled out bent over the desk (standing room only for two), and that afternoon I got a call saying the job was mine.

My friends laughed when I told them I was going into the service industry. I'll admit, I would never have pictured myself that way either. I'm not the type to make friends easily or talk with strangers, and certainly the thought of constant social interaction wasn't a draw for me like it might have been for others. I never minded it too much, though. Once you learn to smile with your eyes, ask people probing questions when they want, leave them alone when they don't, it's easy enough to fake your way through customer interactions, and earn a decent bonus in tips. Most people didn't like their jobs, right?

Still, when I quit, my friends all assumed it was because of that aspect. I let them. it was easier than explaining the real reason I left: my boss.
